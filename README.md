# Basic Math Related Python Codes
 Python codes that solve certain equations and the like

 Created these Python codes to use in other, more complex codes I wanna make. The codes in here mostly just solve certain equations, or find certain math objects. 


 Codes in here:

 1.) Gaussian Elimination Code





 ~ explanation of codes ~

 1.) Gaussian Elimination code allows the user to input a symmetric, n x n matrix A and a vector b, in order to solve the matrix equation Ax = b for the vector x. This code makes use of partial pivoting. Pivoting in Gaussian elimination is a technique used to enhance the numerical stability and accuracy of the method when solving systems of linear equations. It involves rearranging the rows and/or columns of the matrix to position the largest absolute value element in the pivot position before performing the elimination steps.
